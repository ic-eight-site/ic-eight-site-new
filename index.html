      <div style="text-align:center; margin-top:1.2em; margin-bottom:1.2em;">
      <p style="margin-top:1.4em;">You ran your site through DeepL.<br>
      Asked a Japanese friend to check it.<br>
      Launched — and your Japan signup rate is 2%.</p>

      <p>The translation is fine.<br>
      But the UX feels off, and your users notice.</p>

      <p>We don't fix translations.<br>We fix adoption.</p>
      </div>
      <p>IC Eight works with SaaS and global product teams on Japanese UX localization.<br>  
      The goal isn’t translation — it’s making the product feel trusted and usable in Japan.</p>

      <p style="font-weight:550; margin-top:0.8em;">Sound familiar?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You're using NMT (DeepL, Google) because it's fast and cheap</li>
        <li>No one on your team reads Japanese fluently</li>
        <li>You bug a Japanese friend every few weeks to "make sure it's okay"</li>
        <li>You know something's not quite right, but can't pinpoint what</li>
        <li>You're stuck — and you don't know who to ask for help</li>

    <!-- Why This Happens and What We Do -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why This Happens — And What We Do Instead</h2>
      <p>
        Most teams assume that once the English is correct, the translation should simply follow.
        But in Japan, the UX usually breaks long before translation.
      </p>

      <p>
        risk-related wording<br>
        signals of trust<br>
        tone and nuance<br>
        onboarding and help content<br>
        decision-making cues
      </p>

     <p>
       If the language doesn’t feel clear and safe, users hesitate — even when the wording is technically correct.
     </p>

    <p>
      So products end up “localized,” but never quite feel usable or trusted.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>That’s why IC Eight exists.</strong> Not to polish translations — but to shape the Japanese language layer so the product feels intentional, credible, and worth adopting.</p>
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The IC Eight Difference</h2>
      <p>Traditional agencies are built for big launches, not fast iteration.<br>
      You don't need a 50-page style guide and a 3-week turnaround.</p>
      <p>You don't need a vendor.<br>
      You need someone who:
        <ul>
        <li>Understands your product (not just the words)</li>
        <li>Speaks startup pace</li>
        <li>Helps you stay in control, not take it away</li>
        </ul>
      We're not your vendor. We're your Japanese UX layer.</p>
