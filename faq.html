        <h2>AI, MT & Automation</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Do you use AI such as GPT or MT?</summary>
          <p>We use AI where it makes sense.<br>
          However, nothing is ever shipped without native professional review.<br>
          The details of our workflow are not public,
          but AI supports the work — it never replaces human judgment.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Do we have to abandon our current MT setup?</summary>
          <p>No — but IC Eight doesn’t do MT post-editing.<br>
          <p>And that’s not simply a style or nuance preference.
          It’s because MT output is structurally unreliable.</p>

          <p>When machine translation interacts with variables, tags, placeholders, or fragmented strings, it frequently:</p>
	        <ul>
            <li>mistranslates technical elements</li>
	          <li>drops words or full segments</li>
	          <li>breaks meaning across split sentences</li>
	          <li>produces Japanese that no longer fits the UX context</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Fixing that sentence-by-sentence is risky — because you can never be fully confident nothing else broke along the way.</p>

          <p>So instead of repairing MT output, IC Eight usually recommends generating the Japanese directly with LLMs — guided by intent, tone, risk context, and UX clarity from the start. This removes the MTPE failure-points entirely.</p>

          <p>If what you need is traditional MTPE, a different vendor will be a better fit.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>So how much is AI doing — and how much is human?</summary>
          <p>Think of it as a layered process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>AI produces the first draft — guided by clear goals, tone, and audience context</li>
            <li>AI assists with review, highlighting possible risks or inconsistencies</li>
            <li>A senior human expert makes final decisions — shaping clarity, tone, and trust</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This approach saves time — but final responsibility always stays human.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can you work with AI-generated or MT Japanese drafts?</summary>
