      <p class="lead sub">
        Japanese UX localization for SaaS & global product teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        IC Eight is a Japanese UX localization practice.
        We help SaaS and global product teams shape the Japanese experience layer —
        the language, UX logic, and trust signals that determine whether a product is actually usable, trusted, and adopted in Japan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work goes beyond translation. We focus on how wording influences clarity,
        onboarding, and decision-making — especially in AI-driven and English-first products.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than starting from translation, we begin by deciding which parts of the product can safely be automated — and which cannot. Many areas work well with LLM-generated Japanese. Others require human judgment because they affect trust, onboarding, or decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        IC Eight helps teams design that balance, so Japanese can be automated where it makes sense, without relying on MT post-editing.
      </p>

      <p>
        IC Eight is run as a single-operator studio, specializing exclusively in English→Japanese for product teams.
        The approach is lean, collaborative, and designed to integrate with modern workflows — without heavy vendor pipelines.
      </p>
